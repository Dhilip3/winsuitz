WinSuitZ is intended to offer users of a Windows 7 and XP system the possibility to enjoy the look and feel of Windows 8 on their computers. It acts as a start menu that can be used to quickly access important administration and management tools of the PC, while allowing the user to take a glimpse at what the modern UI looks like.
